// There are 20 racers that drive 80 laps.Each lap is 10km.

// Every racecar has speed, fuel, and tire health.

// Every car has a different interval of going to the pit stop.

// The pit stop refuels the fuel tank and changes the tires, however
// it can change to different tires according to the conditions,
// and can give the racecar different upgrades every time the car enters the pitstop.

// Each lap, every driver has a 5 % chance to crash his car and end the race. Who will win ?
