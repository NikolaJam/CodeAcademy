// You are the owner of a football club. Your club plays one game each day for 30 days. 
// At the start of the season you draft 22 players. 
// Every 8 days a major football star comes to play for your club, 
// but you must kick the lowest scoring player in order to make space. 

// Each game you have a 30% chance to score a goal. 
// You have a stadium that has X number of seats. 
// Every day customers come to see the game and fill up the stadium randomly, 
// from 60% to 80% capacity. You have a fanshop that sells player jerseys to 10% 
// of the daily visitors each day, but if your team has scored a goal that day, its 25%. 

// Your hooligan fans fight the opposing fans and cause X amount of monetary damage to your club.
// Calculate the total earnings of the club after 30 days, 
// number of goals scored, number of t-shirts sold, number 
// of seat tickets bought and the total sum of damage from hooligans.
