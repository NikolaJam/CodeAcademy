// A girl tries to impress a boy by flirting with him. 
// Every flirt she makes is worth 1 point, every third flirt is 
// worth 5 points and every 5th flirt is worth 10 points.

// Every 10th flirt the boy gets tired and deducts the girlâ€™s points by 12. 
// Write a function that will calculate if the girl impressed the boy or not, 
// by accepting the number of tries the girl should use and the number of 
// hitpoints the boy has, as function parameters.
