// Create a hotel that will work for 14 days. 
// The hotel has rooms that can be taken/vacant, 
// clean/dirty and have a minibar with items to buy that needs to be restocked. 
// There are employees working in the hotel, that get added through a recruitment drive every 3 days. 
// There is a restaurant in the hotel that serves clients. 
// Each day, clients come to the hotel and stay a few days, 
// paying money for the rooms, the minibar and the restaurant. 
// Choose the price of each by yourself. Every day vacant rooms get cleaned and restocked.

// Calculate the total profit of the hotel after the 14 day work period 
// as well as the number of employees it currently has and the number of 
// guests the hotel served during that period.
